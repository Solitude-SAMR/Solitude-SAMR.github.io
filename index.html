      <p>The project is to validate the feasibility of developing safety argument -- the key technical part of a safety assurance case -- for the deep learning components in an autonomous system, based on verification and validation techniques. For this, we consider real-world underwater robots which are applied to an inspection mission to detect the potential hazards of underwater  critical infrastructure such as deepwater pipelines. For safety concerns, we expect the robots can not only successfully execute the mission but also safely operate  without compromising the integrity of the critical infrastructure and the robots themselves. Technically, we present an overall assurance framework for robots,  develop a reliability assessment model dedicated for deep learning components, and show the construction of safety argument with the support of the reliability assessment model. Moreover, we demonstrate the entire process in both a simulated environment and a real-world water tank, from data collection,  model training,  off-line reliability assessment, to on-line reliability assessment.</p>
